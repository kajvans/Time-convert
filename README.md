there a four different function all who do nealry the same but return something different.

there it ToSec, ToMin, ToHour, ToDay

you give it an input like 4d5h7m18s and it calculates it to Seconds, Minutes, Hours or Days

if your input does not does not look like dhms it is no problem as long as you use one of the letters it works

so ToSec('7h5m') retuns 25500

the programm is not case sensitive so 7H5m or 7h5M will return the same as 7h5m
